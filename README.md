# Crown-of-the-Gods-Stat-Tweeter
Script that logs into a COTG account, reads the resource levels, rank, score and then tweets them out.


The user will need to supply the COTG and Twitter log in details for the scrip to work.


An example Tweet would look like this:

*************

Your Denari balance is: 10,400

Your wood balance is: 7,549

Your stone balance is: 1,420

Your iron balance is: 2,000

Your food balance is: 2,000

Your rank is: 340

Your score is: 12,430


*************

I also added a .bat file that runs the Python script. This way, it should be easier to set up on a reoccuring basis through Windows Task Scheduler (Linux and Mac users will have to make their own solution, sorry!). Just be sure to replace the 'YourNameHere' portion of the file path with your own username.
